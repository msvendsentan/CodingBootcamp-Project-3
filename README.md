There are a lot of convenience applications that extend beyond the restaurant. However, there hasn't been as much development within the sit-down restaurant experience. Our app looks to modernify and spice up the experience making it more convenient and accessible to everyone.

A remote control built for your phone to communicate with the restaurant. From asking for more water, to requesting the bill, and calling for a server, this app aims to modernize and create more efficient practices in the restaurant.
