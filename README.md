A MERN-stack (mongoose, express, react, node) restaurant app for Project 3 of UofT's Coding Bootcamp

**Demo**
* Pending

**Description**
There are a lot of convenience applications that extend beyond the restaurant. However, there hasn't been as much development within the sit-down restaurant experience. Our app looks to modernify and spice up the experience making it more convenient and accessible to everyone.

**Features**
- Customer and Restaurant View
- Secured login for restaurant owners
- Ease of use and functionality

**Future Directions**
- Adding order payment options in app
- Creating profiles for customers to share important information (diet, allergies)
- Streamline the restaurant sign-up and owning confirmation process
